# Remarks for those brave and foolish enough to try and build in MSYS2 environment

**Building in MSYS2 is currently not officially supported. Please do not open issues if it does not work. Creating a redistributable package is a task on its own.**

## Use UCRT64 environment

It will give you the sanest results overall. CLANG64 also should work.

Install *everything* but stuff like `git` with the environment-specific prefix. This includes meson and python!

## Required packages

*This list may be out-of-date since I'll probably forget about it by the time I'll decide to add a new dependency*

```bash
git
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-desktop-file-utils
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gtk4
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libadwaita
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libgusb
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-meson
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-toolchain
${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-vala
```

## Set environment variable `PYTHONUTF8=1`

Otherwise, `blueprint-compiler` will fail with `UnicodeDecodeError`.
